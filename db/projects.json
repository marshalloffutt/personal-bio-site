    "description": "Nashville is home to hundreds of incredible murals, and Muralville is my love-letter to the artists. I wanted to make an application that utilizes a map component allowing users to find, add, and keep track of their favorite murals in Nashville in hopes of accumulating a comprehensive database for all the murals in the city. I made this application with React using a flat-data structure in Firebase. The Leaflet API is used for the map component and utilizes Esri and Bing Maps for Geosearch and autosuggest capabilities. Modals and forms were created using Reactstrap. I used Sketch to help plan the styling of Muralville, and to also edit the logos and images.",

Dev++ is a responsive CRUD application that allows users to add resources to track, and serves as a checklist. Users can sort these resources by type (blog, tutorial, documentation), and check them off as they are completed. This was my first project to build in React JS, and incorporates GitHub’s API to track commits. Modals and forms were created using Reactstrap. FontAwesome icons are used for ‘delete’ and ‘edit’ buttons.",
