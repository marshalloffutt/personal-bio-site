This will be mostly for my own benefit, as these weekly or bi-weekly check-ins should provide a opportunity for personal reflection as I learn more about software development. <br/><br/> Right now I am wrapping up week 18 (has it already been 18 weeks!!??) of the Part-Time Web Developer Bootcamp at Nashville Software School. The subject material for this week is pretty much what my entire cohort has been waiting for: REACT. And I can confidently say that so far React is exactly what we expected it to be. Alien, confusing, but also very exciting! That is one of the things (and there are many!) that has been so great about NSS so far. As soon as we start to get comfortable with one method of doing something, it's time learn something else that changes our entire world. Such is the life of a programmer, so I've been told. <br/><br/> This weekend I'm going to spend some time reading up on the React documentation, and also try to get a head start on our current homework assignment."
